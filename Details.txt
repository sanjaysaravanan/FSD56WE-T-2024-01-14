Requirements to Start Coding:

CodeKata Topics:

  Datatypes:
    Basic Primitive:
      Number, String, Boolean, undefined (default value for a declaration) ( not yet defined ), null ( empty forever )
    
    Composite: ( combination of Primitive types together )
      Array: sequential storage with incremantal index
      
      Object: key <-> value pair where key acts as an index/identifier

  Variables:
    naming a storage which contains some values in JS Memory during run time

    var i = 0;

    var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];

    Declartion:
      var a;
      let a;
    initialization
      a = 100;

  String Methods:
    split

  Typecasting: changing the datatype of the value
    Number to string
    string to number

    typeof

  Array Methods:

    get length of an array

    array.join

    length -> single value ( property/attribute ) lenght of the array

    push -> method/function (action) insert an element at last
      return new length( number of elements in the array ) of the array
    pop -> method/function (action) remove an element from last
      return the removed element value

  Prepaartion for CodeKata:

Task:
  Downloads & Installation:
    1. VSCode - https://code.visualstudio.com/download
    2. NodeJS - https://nodejs.org/en/download

    Install both the downloaded Items

  VScode Extensions:
    Live Server - Ritwick Dey
    vscode Icons - VsCode Icons Team
    Sonarlint - Sonarsource
    EsLint - Microsoft
    HTML CSS Support - ecmel
    HTML - Snippets - geyao
    Bracket Pair Colorization Toggler - Dzhavat Ushev
    Tabnine: AI Autocomplete & Chat

  Create a separate for CodeKata: 

    Create a folder for Input/Output Concept
  
    Open in VSCode

  note: **Do Not Start CodeKata Coding, We will start next Week**

Next Session:

  Scope
    global ---> parent scope every scopes ()

      function ( inside function (){} )

      block {}

    {} ---> block of lines

    [] ---> Array of elements

    () ---> methods/functions

  looping, conditions, simple problems

    looping: it is a process of repeating a block statements again and again

    for, while, do while

    how many times or when to stop the looping

    concepts in looping
    initialization, termination condition, inc/drec

  Conditional Statements:

    Operators:

      Arithemetic: +, -, *, /, %( 5 % 2 ---> 1 ( remainder) )
      Assignment: =
      Logical: &(and), |(or), !(not), &&, ||
      compariason: >, <, >=, <=, !=, ==, ===
      Boolean: true or false

    == vs ===

    LHS vs RHS

    if else

    

  Iteration of iterable types:
